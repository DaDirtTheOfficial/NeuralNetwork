# My First Attempt at Making a Neural Network


## Overview

This project took approximately **50 hours** of coding in **C++**. The neural network features a **self-training** mechanism, allowing it to refine its outputs automatically if errors occur.

## Features

- **Self-Training**: The network can repeat its learning process to correct mistakes.
- **Matrix Calculations**: Capable of performing complex matrix operations.
- **Function Limits**: Can compute limits of mathematical functions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and build it using your preferred C++ compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
# Follow additional setup instructions here
```

## Usage

Once set up, you can run the neural network by executing:

```bash
./your_executable
```

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs!
